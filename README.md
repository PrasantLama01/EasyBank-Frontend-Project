## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I took mobile first approach for the development of this project.
I used Josh W Comeau's Custom CSS Reset to help me in css styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned how to use flex-basis to make a responsive layout for things like features section and article section.



### Continued development

I was not able to develop the hero-img section exactly like needed from design, it was mainly because of the difficult layout that I faced there, therefore I will be focusing on it more in future developments. The hover effects and nav hover effect are another things that I will come back to work on at later time.
